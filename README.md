### **Google Data Studio Dashboard - Digital Marketing Campaign Buenos Aires City Government**

**[URL]**(https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/790fc121-134d-48f3-9afe-cc9edaff478a)

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital marketing campaign promoting a technology education program for citizens. The analysis aims to gain insights into the campaign's performance metrics. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in the data, enabling informed decision-making for future marketing strategies.

**Description:** This analysis focuses on a dataset comprising metrics from digital marketing platforms, specifically Google Ads, Meta Ads, and Twitter. The dataset includes key performance indicators such as CTR, Cost, Budget, Clicks, and Impressions for the months of August and September. The project workflow involves data extraction, data cleaning, visualization, and comparative analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to uncover patterns and correlations in the campaign data.

**Skills:** Data extraction, data cleaning, comparative analysis, data visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Technology:** Google Data Studio, Data manipulation and visualization tools.

**Results:** The project presents a visually intuitive dashboard comparing the campaign metrics (CTR, Cost, Budget, Clicks, and Impressions) across Google Ads, Meta Ads, and Twitter for the months of August and September. The analysis provides actionable insights into the effectiveness of the marketing strategies employed on each platform. Through comparative visualization, trends are identified, enabling stakeholders to optimize budget allocation, refine ad creatives, and enhance overall campaign performance for subsequent marketing initiatives.

**Analysis:** Examining the metrics of the Tech Education Marketing Campaign in August and September uncovers intricate dynamics. Despite a doubled budget in September, the marginal uptick in Click-Through Rate (CTR) suggests a saturation point, emphasizing the need for refined targeting strategies rather than mere financial injections.
A pivotal observation lies in platform-specific behaviors. Meta Ads experienced a decline in impressions and clicks, demanding tailored optimizations to regain lost ground. Meanwhile, Google Ads consistently exhibited the highest CTR, indicating a robust resonance with the audience.
To optimize, a multifaceted approach is vital. Cost-efficiency should be the linchpin, guiding resource reallocation to maximize impact within budget constraints. Dive deeper into the data for nuanced CTR enhancements, understanding audience interactions on a granular level. Platform-specific strategies must be employed, acknowledging the unique audience behavior on each platform, thereby customizing ad content and delivery.
Moreover, the implementation of a vigilant, real-time monitoring system emerges as indispensable. It ensures proactive adaptation, allowing the campaign to pivot swiftly in response to evolving market dynamics.
This comprehensive strategy, encompassing cost optimization, granular CTR analysis, platform-specific tailoring, and agile real-time monitoring, will not only enhance the campaign’s efficiency but also establish a resilient framework for future marketing endeavors.
